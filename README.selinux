If you're running with selinux enforcing, httpd will not be able
to initiate outbound connections by default (since it could thereby
be used as a springboard for attacks).

To enable connections to other http server instances, use:

# setsebool httpd_can_network_relay 1

of course, this presumes that your rewriting rules are well-written
and sufficiently restrictive.
